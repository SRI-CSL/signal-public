## Description
SIGNAL's goal is to model socio-technical activity in OSS projects with such fidelity that you could feed it to a ML algorithm of your choice in order to highlight emergent developer influence, drifts in standards or wrong design choices that could potentially undermine the integrity of an OSS project.


**In support of DARPA AIE Hybrid AI to Protect Integrity of Open-Source Code (SocialCyber)**
