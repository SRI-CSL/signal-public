    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Open-source communities strive to evaluate contributed code on its technical correctness\n",
    "and merits. However, these processes are usually loosely supervised and are often\n",
    "influenced by additional factors, including here but not limited to, social rules, trust,\n",
    "reputation, and arcane processes. These additional components lead to *unexpected*\n",
    "opportunities for subversion. Current approaches, designed to help software development\n",
    "teams to manage the code assessment process, determine the trustworthiness of OSS based on\n",
    "publicly available traces involving code, revision history, logs, and external packages.\n",
    "Although useful, these approaches tend to disregard important inter-and-intra developer\n",
    "interactions that could drastically affect an OSS project's life-cycle. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we\n",
    "introduce a systematic approach and a deep multi-task learning architecture, termed\n",
    "**dev2vec**, for identifying and understanding these developer interactions. We\n",
    "empirically evaluate our approach and deep multi-task learning architecture on the Linux\n",
    "Kernel, a mature ecosystem with a vibrant community and a wealth of socio-technical\n",
    "developer interactions, utilizing conversations and interactions originating from its\n",
    "Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML). Our approach successfully identifies key developer\n",
    "activities determining the distinct roles developers assume in the LKML. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we motivate the need for understanding the inter-and-intra developer in\n",
    "large OSS projects, particularly in the context of case study: the Linux Kernel and its\n",
    "mailing list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Linux Kernel(LK) [1] is a mature\n",
    "open-source software with a vibrant community. In the last couple of decades, it has grown\n",
    "and evolved into a large open-source ecosystem. As an ecosystem, it spawns a sufficiently\n",
    "\\textit{diverse set of social and technical interactions} through the involvement of\n",
    "heterogenous community in its Linux Kernel Mailing List (LKML) [2]. It has a hierarchy of mature sub-systems, each of these sub-systems have history\n",
    "of developer interactions and thus can be used *to evidence common behavioral\n",
    "patterns*. For these reasons, we have chosen the LK as our case study. With this case\n",
    "study, we seek to understand how contributions are carried out over time and thus capture\n",
    "common behavioral patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "Motivated by these considerations, our work builds upon a general work in Activity-based\n",
    "analysis of OSS projects [3], specializes it to LK case study, and\n",
    "then extends it with a deep multi-task learning architecture to model developer behavior and\n",
    "thus capture role dynamism over a user-specified time window. The latter is inspired by\n",
    "work in user simulation using recurrent neural networks [4]. In this user\n",
    "simulation work, recurrent neural networks are applied to describing users in a given\n",
    "domain without expert supervision [5].\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish this understanding of developer actions, roles, and these roles dynamism, we\n",
    "first collect and curate data from the LKML within a user-specified time window. These\n",
    "data contains key attributes concerning communication and interactions among LK\n",
    "developers. We then transform them to make sure we can learn a function that maps a sequence\n",
    "of past developer activity as input to a series of observations, within the specified\n",
    "window. This transformation effort aims capturing concrete actions taken by LK developers from\n",
    "different perspectives, which have grown and evolved over time. In the Table below, we enlist the transformed data.\n",

    "minimize the sum of the loss functions [9]. MTL is well-suited\n",

    "related to future developer activity.\n",

    "\n",
    "We now move on to  introducing ***dev2vec***, our LSTM-based multi-task learning model designed to learn from a sequence of past developer activities and output a series of observations corresponding to the upcoming (future) developer actions. Note that, we use the term *dev2vec* interchangeably referring to the data representation or the deep MTL architecture, depending on the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "![dev2vec architecture](figures/dev2vec.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The design of *dev2vec*'s architecture, Figure above, is inspired by the work of Zolna et\n",
    "al. [5]. In this work, the authors use an Long-Short-Term Memory\n",
    "(LSTM)-based MTL architecture to describe to describe the characteristics of users\n",
    "involved in Real-Time Bidding online auction events. Similarly, we aim at having a model\n",
    "capable of answering questions of interest regarding future developer actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our deep MTL model is sequential in structure. It takes as input a sequence of vectors\n",
    "composed of $n$-floating point numbers in the $[-1, 1]$ range. Here, the term $n$ refers\n",
    "to the number of features depicting developer characteristics that we extracted through\n",
    "factor analysis. The input is fed to an LSTM layer with 300 memory cells, applying a\n",
    "dropout of $0.15$. Differently from *user2vec*, our second LSTM layer also contains\n",
    "300-memory cells. The output of the last LSTM layer is then fed as input to 3-different\n",
    "fully connected (FC) layers, or *heads*, as commonly referred in the literature. Each\n",
    "FC model is trained to answer to one of the following questions of interest:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Will the next action be a triage action?\n",
    "2. Will the next action result in a small code change?\n",
    "3. Will the next action result in a controversial code change, sparking a lot of discussions?\n",
    "\n",
    "We bring to the attention of the reader that the architecture can be easily extended to accommodate different tasks of interest.\n",
